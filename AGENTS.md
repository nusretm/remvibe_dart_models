# Codex repository instructions

Read `docs/WORKING_RULES.md` and relevant README/continuity documents before planning, implementation or review. Protect the pure Dart API, ownership boundaries and current validated behavior. Require explicit user approval before implementation or merge. Report only verification actually performed.

## Codex visual-acceptance boundary (2026-11-10)

- **Do not delegate visual/UI acceptance to Codex.** Codex must not use computer-use, screenshots, remote desktop, GUI automation, or manual window inspection to perform or claim visual verification. Do not request permission to do so.
- **The user performs visual acceptance.** If visual inspection is required, stop at that gate, give the user concise manual verification steps, and record the result as **NOT VISUALLY VERIFIED** until the user explicitly reports acceptance.
- Non-visual work remains allowed: source review, implementation, automated tests (including widget/integration tests), static analysis, builds, CLI/API checks, artifact integrity, executable metadata, and logs. These checks are not substitutes for user-observed UI acceptance.
- Never assert that a window rendered correctly, an interaction looked right, or visual acceptance passed solely from test results, process existence, screenshots, or tool output.
